ACQUIRE - Getting workforce data from professional repositories

What I needed:
• Baseline diversity numbers for US workforce
• See if there's actual gaps in hiring/employment
• Need reliable government data not just opinions

My main questions:
• What does actual workforce diversity look like today?
• Are some groups really underrepresented or is that just perception?
• How has this changed over time?
• What industries have the biggest gaps?

Where I got data:

BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics):
• Main federal agency tracking employment data
• Does surveys of like 60,000 households every month
• Tracks who's working, in what jobs, making what money
• Free access, publicly available at bls.gov

USAFacts:
• Website that visualizes government data
• Takes federal numbers and makes them easier to read
• Good for seeing trends over time
• Free, no paywall

EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission):
• Collects diversity data from companies
• Employers with 100+ employees have to report
• Shows breakdown by job level and demographics
• Can see actual private sector numbers

Why these sources:
• All government/official data
• Not surveys or opinions but actual numbers
• Cover millions of workers
• Updated regularly
• Free to access

### 5. Prospective Diverse Candidate Perspectives

#### Evaluation Criteria
- **Job Posting Language:** Do they see themselves reflected? Is language inclusive?
- **Representation Signals:** Do company photos/leadership pages show diversity?

- **Lack of Transparency:** "If you won't share diversity data, you're hiding something"
- **Negative Reviews:** "If Glassdoor shows bias complaints, I'm out"

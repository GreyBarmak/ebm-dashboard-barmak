CRITICALLY APPRAISE - Are these sources trustworthy?

Overall quality rating: A (high quality)
Feel confident using all three sources. They're credible and mostly agree with each other.

Source 1: HBR article (Dobbin & Kalev)

Credibility factors:

Author credentials:
• Frank Dobbin is a Harvard sociology professor
• Alexandra Kalev is UC Berkeley sociology professor
• Both have 30+ years studying organizations
• Published tons of peer-reviewed papers on diversity
• These are legit academic experts not random people

Study quality:
• Studied 800+ companies over 30 years
• That's a HUGE sample size and timeframe
• Longitudinal data (tracked same companies over time)
• Not just a survey but actual diversity numbers
• Can see what happened before and after interventions

Publication quality:
• Published in Harvard Business Review (top journal)
• Peer-reviewed by other academics
• HBR is super prestigious in business world
• Had to meet high standards to get published

What makes me trust it:
• Massive sample (800 companies)
• Long timeframe (30 years)
• Peer-reviewed publication
• Authors are credible experts
• They show what DOESN'T work not just successes

Potential limitations:
• Published in 2016 so almost 10 years old
• DEI landscape might have changed since then
• Mostly large companies in their sample
• Don't know much about small business applicability

Bias assessment:
• Financial interest: LOW - academics don't profit from this
• They're not selling consulting services
• Pro-DEI stance but critically examine failures
• Actually show when programs backfire

My rating: A+
This is high quality academic research. Only knock is it's from 2016.

Source 2: McKinsey "Diversity Wins" report

Credibility factors:

Organization reputation:
• McKinsey is top tier consulting firm
• Known for rigorous data analysis
• Work with Fortune 500 companies
• Have dedicated diversity research team

Study scope:
• Analyzed 1,000+ companies
• Across 15 different countries
• Multiple years of data (2015-2020)
• Links diversity to actual financial performance

Methodology:

• Part of ongoing research series ("Diversity Matters")

What makes me trust it:
• Huge dataset (1000+ companies)
• Multiple countries for comparison
• Shows actual numbers and statistics
• Consistent with their earlier reports
• Other researchers cite this a lot

Potential limitations:
• McKinsey SELLS diversity consulting
• They benefit if companies think they need help
• Might overstate need for consulting support
• Not peer-reviewed academic research
• Some methods are proprietary (can't fully verify)

Bias assessment:
• Financial interest: MODERATE - they sell consulting
• Could emphasize problems that need consultants
• Pro-DEI stance (obviously)
• Focus on business case serves their interests
• But data seems solid even with bias risk

My rating: A
Solid research despite commercial interests. Massive dataset but watch for sales pitch.

What they offer:

What makes me trust it:

• They publish lots of research that's well regarded

Potential limitations:

My rating: A
Great for practical implementation perspective. Not as rigorous as academic research but very useful.

• Don't know if this works for small businesses
• My problem focuses on general US hiring though

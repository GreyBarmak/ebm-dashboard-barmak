CRITICALLY APPRAISE - Checking if the data is legit

Overall rating: A- (high quality)
All federal government sources with good methods. Can trust this data.

### Data Source Reliability

#### Primary Data Sources
**Data Source 1: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Population Survey**
- **Reliability Rating:** Very High
- **Data Collection Method:** Monthly household survey of ~60,000 households selected through probability sampling
- **Update Frequency:** Monthly data collection; annual averages published annually
- **Historical Availability:** Consistent data back to 1970s; some series back to 1940s
- **Known Limitations:** Self-reported employment status; sampling error ±0.2-0.5 percentage points for major demographics; doesn't capture underground economy

**Data Source 2: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO-1 Data**
- **Reliability Rating:** High (with caveats)
- **Data Collection Method:** Employer self-reporting annually; required for employers with 100+ employees
- **Update Frequency:** Annual collection; aggregate public data released with 3-5 year lag
- **Historical Availability:** Data collected since 1966; public aggregate data varies by release
- **Known Limitations:** Not all required employers file; self-reported by employers; smaller employers exempt; significant publication lag

**Data Source 3: USAFacts**
- **Reliability Rating:** High (derivative source)
- **Data Collection Method:** Aggregates and visualizes federal government data (primarily from BLS, Census Bureau)
- **Update Frequency:** Updated as source data (BLS, Census) is published
- **Historical Availability:** Depends on underlying federal data sources
- **Known Limitations:** Derivative source (not original data); relies on federal data quality; visualization choices may emphasize certain patterns

#### Data Integration Assessment
**Cross-System Consistency:** High - BLS and EEOC data show consistent patterns; USAFacts derivative from BLS
**Data Definition Consistency:** High - Federal sources use standardized OMB race/ethnicity definitions
**Temporal Alignment:** Good - Most data from same time periods (2013-2024); EEOC lags by 3-5 years

### Measurement Quality Analysis

#### Validity Assessment
**Face Validity:** High - Measures obviously relate to employment diversity and hiring outcomes
- **Problem Relevance Score:** Very High - Labor force demographics, unemployment rates, and representation in occupations directly measure problem
- **Direct vs. Proxy Measures:** Mostly direct measures - actual employment status, demographics, occupations, earnings

**Construct Validity:** High - Measures capture intended constructs well
- **Measurement Alignment:** Employment status, occupation categories, and earnings align with theoretical concepts of workforce diversity
- **Confounding Factors:** Education, geography, industry concentration affect outcomes but can be partially controlled

**Criterion Validity:** High - Measures correlate with external standards
- **External Validation:** BLS data is gold standard for US labor market statistics; widely cited and validated
- **Predictive Value:** Historical employment patterns predict future workforce composition and disparities

#### Reliability Assessment
**Measurement Consistency:** Very High - Federal statistical methods are highly consistent over time
- **Temporal Stability:** BLS uses same CPS methodology for decades; similar conditions produce similar measurements
- **Inter-Rater Reliability:** Standardized survey instruments and interviewer training ensure consistency
- **Internal Consistency:** Related measures (e.g., unemployment by race, representation by race) align logically

**Error Sources:** [What might make measurements unreliable]
- **Systematic Errors:** [Consistent biases in measurement]
- **Random Errors:** [Inconsistent noise in measurement]
- **Human Errors:** [Mistakes in data collection or entry]

### Bias Assessment

#### Selection Bias
**Data Availability Bias:** 
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Issue:** BLS CPS uses probability sampling; EEOC requires reporting from large employers (100+ employees)
- **Impact:** Small employers (<100 employees) not included in EEOC data; BLS sample-based so rare populations have wider error margins

**Survivorship Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Issue:** BLS captures all employed and unemployed; EEOC captures active employers
- **Impact:** Minimal - data includes both employed and unemployed workers

#### Measurement Bias
**Gaming/Manipulation Risk:**
- **Risk Level:** Low (BLS), Moderate (EEOC)
- **Issue:** BLS is independent household survey, hard to manipulate; EEOC is employer self-reported
- **Mitigation:** BLS uses trained interviewers and standardized protocols; EEOC data is legally required filings with penalties for false reporting

**Reporting Bias:**
- **Risk Level:** Low

ACQUIRE - How I found 2+ peer-reviewed studies

What I was looking for:
• At least 2 peer-reviewed articles on hiring bias
 Studies that test if DEI stuff works
 US-based research, recent (2015-2025)
 Actual experiments not just surveys

Databases I used:
 Google Scholar - free, searches everything
 JSTOR - academic business journals  
 JMU Library - school access to paywalled stuff
 Searched September-October 2024

Search terms:
• "hiring bias" AND "diversity"
• "DEI practices" AND "recruitment"
• "employment discrimination" experiments
• "structured interview" bias reduction

The 2 studies I picked:

Study 1 - Ameri & Kurtzberg (2025):
 About how DEI statements affect hiring people with disabilities
 Published in Disability and Health Journal
 Experiment with 1,655 managers making hiring decisions
• Found heartfelt DEI language helps reduce bias

Study 2 - Hardy et al. (2022):
 Meta-analysis of hiring bias across 6 studies
 Published in Journal of Management
 Combined data then simulated 1 million job applications  
 Shows even small bias causes huge long-term problems

Why these work:
 Both peer-reviewed in top journals
 Both recent (2022 and 2025)
 Different methods (experiment + meta-analysis)
 Together show bias exists AND what happens over time

How I picked them:
 Found 47 articles total from searches
 Cut down to 18 after reading abstracts
 Fully read 12 papers
 Chose these 2 as best fit for my questions

Quality checks I did:
 Peer-reviewed? (required)
 Big sample size?
 Good methodology? (experiments beat surveys)
 Relevant to US hiring?

- Journal: Journal of Management  
- DOI: 10.1177/0149206320982654
- Publication Date: March 2022

**Study Design & Methodology:**
- Study Design: Meta-analysis combined with large-scale computer simulation modeling
- Research Approach: Two-phase study: (1) Updated meta-analysis of hiring experiments, (2) Stochastic process simulation modeling
- Data Collection: Meta-analysis of 6 articles (7 experiments) + simulation with 1 million applicant data points
- Time Frame: Meta-analysis of recent studies (2015+) + simulation of long-term hiring outcomes

**Sample Characteristics:**
- Meta-analysis Sample: 6 articles with 7 experiments manipulating candidate gender and qualifications
- Simulation Sample: 1 million simulated applicants across multiple hiring scenarios
- Industry: Cross-industry focus on gender-neutral and male-typed jobs
- Geographic Location: United States hiring contexts
- Demographics: Focus on gender bias effects in managerial/hiring decision contexts

**DEI Interventions Studied:**
- Specific DEI Practices: Examination of diversity-oriented staffing practices including targeted recruitment, assessment validity improvements
- Implementation Details: Simulation modeling of various diversity interventions and their interaction with underlying bias
- Measurement Tools: Meta-analytic effect sizes used as simulation parameters
- Control Variables: Selection ratios, base rates, assessment validity, organizational context factors

**Outcomes Measured:**
- Primary Outcomes: Hiring discrimination (impact ratios, odds ratios), disparate treatment rates, organizational performance metrics
- Secondary Outcomes: New hire failure rates, system utility loss, financial impact of bias
- Measurement Tools: Meta-analytic Cohen's d values, simulation-based outcome metrics
- Time Periods: Long-term cumulative effects across multiple hiring decisions

**Key Findings:**
- Main Results: Small gender bias (d=-0.30) produces substantial discriminatory outcomes; even 1% bias variance creates practically significant adverse impact
- Effect Sizes: Gender bias d=-0.30 vs. qualifications effect d=1.61; bias effects small but consequential
- Organizational Impact: 4% bias effect results in $17M annual productivity loss for Fortune 500 company; 1% bias still costs $2.8M annually
- Intervention Effectiveness: Targeted recruitment and validity improvements help but cannot eliminate bias effects when systematic bias remains

**Quality Assessment:**
- Strengths: Meta-analysis + simulation design, large-scale modeling (1M data points), multiple outcome metrics, comprehensive sensitivity analyses
- Limitations: Meta-analysis based mostly on lab experiments, simplified simulation assumptions, focus on gender only (not intersectionality)
- Bias Considerations: Conservative bias estimates used, extensive robustness testing across scenarios
- Generalizability: US-based findings, applicable across industries and hiring contexts

**Relevance to Your Research:**
- Hiring Bias Question: DIRECTLY addresses how bias affects recruitment processes and hiring outcomes - central to research question
- Performance Outcomes: Demonstrates both individual discrimination and organizational performance consequences of hiring bias
- Short vs Long-term: Simulation shows cumulative long-term effects of bias across multiple hiring decisions
- Mechanisms: Identifies key principle that "all bias matters, no matter how small" - critical insight for DEI interventions

**Connections to Other Evidence Types:**
- Practitioner Links: References orchestra blind auditions, anonymous hiring procedures as real-world bias reduction strategies
- Organizational Data: Uses organizational hiring benchmarks, salary data, Fortune 500 company scenarios
- Stakeholder Perspectives: Addresses hiring manager bias, applicant discrimination experiences, organizational legal/financial risks

**DEI Interventions Studied:**
- Specific DEI Practices: Two types of DEI statements - "Legal/Traditional" (boilerplate equal opportunity language) vs "Heartfelt" (vivid, sincere commitment to equity and inclusion)
- Implementation Details: Participants exposed to company DEI statements before making hiring decisions
- Measurement Tools: Experimental manipulation with controlled exposure to different DEI language
- Control Variables: Disability type (none, visible, invisible-neurological, invisible-mental health), candidate tone (warm vs overconfident)

**Outcomes Measured:**
- Primary Outcomes: Employability ratings, perceived risk as new hire, negotiation skills assessment, integrity perceptions
- Secondary Outcomes: General reactions to candidates, qualitative feedback on hiring decisions
- Measurement Tools: Quantitative scales and qualitative response items
- Time Periods: Immediate post-exposure assessment of hiring intentions and candidate evaluations

**Key Findings:**
- Main Results: Heartfelt DEI statements significantly improved employability ratings for candidates with disabilities (M=5.11 vs M=4.99, p=0.032, Cohen's d=-0.11)
- Effect Sizes: Stronger effects for invisible disabilities compared to visible disabilities
- Disability Type Effects: Candidates with invisible disabilities rated as less employable overall (p<0.001), with mental health disabilities more stigmatized than neurological ones
- Interaction Effects: DEI statement type interacted with disability status to influence hiring decisions

**Quality Assessment:**
- Strengths: Large sample (n=1,655), randomized controlled design, IRB approval, CONSORT guidelines followed, controlled experimental conditions
- Limitations: Single-day data collection, online convenience sample, artificial hiring scenario, no long-term follow-up
- Bias Considerations: Controlled experimental design minimizes confounding, random assignment ensures causal inference
- Generalizability: US-based sample with management experience, applicable across industries and organizational contexts

**Relevance to Your Research:**
- Hiring Bias Question: DIRECTLY addresses how DEI statements affect bias in recruitment processes - perfect match
- Performance Outcomes: Focuses on hiring decisions and employability assessments rather than post-hire performance
- Short vs Long-term: Immediate effects measured, but no longitudinal follow-up (limitation for long-term effects research)
- Mechanisms: Identifies DEI statement language as key mechanism for reducing hiring bias against people with disabilities

**Connections to Other Evidence Types:**
- Practitioner Links: References company website DEI statements and job advertisement language as real-world applications
- Organizational Data: Uses experimental company contexts; applicable to organizational DEI policy decisions
- Stakeholder Perspectives: Focuses on hiring manager perspectives; addresses candidate experiences and perceptions of fair treatment

ACQUIRE - Mapping who cares about DEI hiring

What I was trying to do:
• Figure out who has power to make or block DEI changes
• Understand what different groups want or are worried about
• Map out stakeholders using power/interest framework

Who I identified:
• Senior leadership (CEO, executives) - high power, high interest
• HR and recruiting teams - high power, very high interest
• Hiring managers - moderate power, moderate interest
• Diverse employees - low power, very high interest
- **Key Questions Focus:**
  - What barriers do you experience in workplace inclusion?
  - What would make our organization more attractive to diverse candidates?
  - What retention challenges do diverse employees face?

#### 5. Current Employees (Majority Groups)
- **Target Participants:** White employees, male employees in gender-diverse initiatives
- **Power Level:** Low-Moderate - Individual voice, potential resistance to DEI can derail initiatives
- **Interest Level:** Moderate - May fear "reverse discrimination," losing opportunities, or support inclusive culture
- **Engagement Method:** Anonymous surveys, town halls, diversity training feedback
- **Key Questions Focus:**
  - What concerns do you have about DEI initiatives?
  - How do you understand the business case for diversity?
  - What would help you support inclusive hiring?

#### 6. Recruiting / Talent Acquisition Teams
- **Target Participants:** Recruiters, sourcing specialists, university relations coordinators
- **Power Level:** Moderate - Candidate pipeline control, sourcing strategy implementation
- **Interest Level:** Very High - Directly responsible for candidate diversity, process efficiency, hiring metrics
- **Engagement Method:** Operational workshops, process feedback sessions, metrics review
- **Key Questions Focus:**
  - What sourcing challenges exist for diverse candidates?
  - What tools/resources would expand diverse pipelines?
  - Where do process inefficiencies create barriers?

### External Stakeholders

#### 7. Prospective Employees (Diverse Candidates)
- **Target Participants:** Job applicants from underrepresented groups, professional association members
- **Power Level:** Low - Individual choice to apply, collectively represent talent market
- **Interest Level:** Very High - Evaluating employer attractiveness, assessing inclusive culture signals
- **Engagement Method:** Candidate experience surveys, application data analysis, focus groups with professional associations
- **Key Questions Focus:**
  - What signals of inclusive culture do you look for?
  - What concerns deter you from applying?
  - What would make our organization attractive?

#### 8. Customers / Clients
- **Target Participants:** Customer segments valuing diversity, B2B clients with supplier diversity requirements

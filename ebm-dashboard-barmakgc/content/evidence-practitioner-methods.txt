ACQUIRE - How I gathered practitioner perspectives

What I was trying to find:
• Real-world insights from people who actually work in DEI and HR
• Wanted to know what works and what fails in actual companies
• Looking for senior professionals with 5+ years experience doing this stuff

Who I was looking for:
• Chief Diversity Officers and HR Directors
• People working in tech, finance, healthcare (where bias seems bad)
• Folks at mid to large companies (500+ employees)
• US-based since that's my focus

Why I used published sources instead of interviews:
• Don't have access to interview actual CDOs for a class project
• Published research already covers hundreds of companies
• Sources like HBR and McKinsey already did the interviewing
• These are vetted and credible unlike random LinkedIn posts

The 3 main sources I picked:

1. Harvard Business Review article by Dobbin & Kalev
• These are Harvard and UC Berkeley professors
• Studied 800+ companies for 30 years
• Published in peer-reviewed journal in 2016
• Found it on HBR website (publicly available)

2. McKinsey "Diversity Wins" report
• Big consulting firm that tracks 1000+ companies
• Published in 2020 with data from 15 countries
• Shows connection between diversity and financial performance
• Got it from McKinsey website (free download)

3. SHRM research and guidance
• Society for HR Management has 300k members
• They publish what actually works for HR people
• Published 2020 with implementation tips
• Found on SHRM website (publicly available)

Why these specific sources work:
• All published and easy to access
• Cover TONS of companies not just one case study
• Recent enough (2015-2020) to be relevant today
• Mix of academic (HBR) and practical (SHRM)
• All focused on US organizations

What I looked for when reading:
• What problems do practitioners actually see with DEI?
• What solutions did they try and did they work?
• What failed and why did it fail?
• What recommendations do they make?
• Any data or numbers to back it up?

How I picked what to include:
• Needed at least 3 credible sources
• Wanted peer-reviewed or from major consulting firms
• Had to be recent (2015-2025)
• Preferred sources with lots of companies not just one
• Made sure it applies to US context

Questions I asked for each source:
• Who wrote this and what are their credentials?
• How many companies did they study?
• What industries and company sizes?
• What specific problems did they identify?
• What solutions did they recommend?
• Do they have actual data or just opinions?
• Can I trust this source?

Where I found everything:
• Google Scholar for academic articles
• HBR website for the Dobbin & Kalev article
• McKinsey website for consulting reports
• SHRM website for HR practitioner guidance
• Also checked company DEI reports for examples

What I documented for each:
• Full citation (author, year, title, publication)
• Author credentials and why they're credible
• Number of companies/organizations studied
• Key problems they identified
• Solutions they recommend
• What worked vs what failed
• Whether it applies to US companies
• My assessment of source quality

How I organized my search:
• Week 1-2: Searched databases and found the 3 main sources
• Week 3-4: Read everything and took detailed notes
• Week 5: Compared what all sources said, looked for patterns
• Focused on areas where sources agreed vs disagreed

Challenges I dealt with:
• Some McKinsey stuff was paywalled but found public versions
• Had to check credibility since not all sources are equal
• Balancing recent research vs more thorough older studies
• Making sure I wasn't just cherry-picking stuff that agreed

Why this approach works for class:
• Using published research is appropriate for coursework
• Don't need to interview actual executives for this
• Sources are already vetted and credible
• Covers way more companies than I could ever interview
• Gives me both academic and practical perspectives

# Problem Definition Framework
# Use this template to clearly define your management problem

## X â†’ Y Framework
### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)
US organizations want to have diverse workplaces and it may be causing negative ripple effects

### Desired State (Y - What outcome do we want to achieve?)
Organizations implement evidence based DEI hiring practices that demonstrably reduce bias, improve recruitment outcomes for underrepresented groups
## PICOC Framework
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
Hiring managers and recruitment professionals in US organizations making employment decisions

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Evidence-based DEI hiring practices including:
"Heartfelt" authentic diversity statement language vs. legal/traditional boilerplate
Systematic bias reduction strategies including targeted recruitment, assessment validity improvements, structured interviews
Long-term sustainable DEI program implementation with measurable outcomes and longitudinal tracking

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
Traditional approach: Legal compliance focused DEI statements with boilerplate equal opportunity language
Status quo: No formal DEI interventions ("business as usual" hiring practices)
Performative DEI: Short-term surface-level diversity initiatives without substance or measurement
Generic training: One size fits all diversity training without structural process changes

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Bias Reduction: Measurable reduction in hiring bias
Improved Hiring: Enhanced employability ratings for underrepresented candidates without compromising qualifications
Financial Impact: Positive ROI with bias reduction saving $ for Fortune 500 companies
Sustained Change: Long term positive impact over 2+ years
Authentic Diversity: Increased workplace diversity through genuine inclusion rather than tokenism
Organizational Culture: Reduced negative ripple effects and improved employee trust in DEI efforts

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
Geographic: US-based organizations across industries
When: During hiring cycles

## Clear Problem Statement
US organizations struggle with non-diverse workplaces and lack evidence-based guidance on which DEI hiring practices effectively reduce bias without creating negative ripple effects, leading to ineffective DEI investments, continued inequitable hiring outcomes, and potential backlash despite organizational diversity commitments and financial investments.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
Financial Losses
Legal Liability
Talent Drain (Not hired correct people)
Resource Waste: Ineffective DEI programs that don't create measurable change

### Stakeholder Impact
Job Candidates: Continued experience of bias and reduced opportunities for underrepresented groups
Hiring Managers: Confusion and lack of clear, practical tools to reduce unconscious bias in decision making processes
HR Leaders: Pressure to implement DEI programs without evidence based guidance on effectiveness
Current Employees: Poor replacements for them / bad team members
Executives: Uncertainty about DEI ROI, risk of programs creating unintended consequences

### Strategic Alignment
Diversity Goals: Supports organizational commitments to diversity, inclusion, and equitable workplace culture
Risk Management: Aligns with legal compliance requirements
Competitive Advantage: Contributes to better talent acquisition, retention, and innovation
Reputation Management: Enhances organizational reputation while avoiding DEI backlash
Financial Performance: Supports sustainable business performance through evidence based resource allocation

## Evidence Questions to Explore

### Question 1: Do DEI hiring practices actually reduce bias?
Is there empirical evidence that diversity statements, inclusive job postings, and DEI-focused recruitment strategies measurably reduce hiring bias? What types of DEI language or approaches are most effective at changing hiring manager behavior and decision-making?

### Question 2: What is the financial impact of hiring bias on organizations?
How much does hiring bias cost companies in terms of lost productivity, legal liability, and missed talent opportunities? Is there a quantifiable business case for investing in bias reduction strategies?

### Question 3: Do DEI initiatives create unintended negative consequences?
Can DEI programs backfire or create negative ripple effects such as employee resentment, tokenism concerns, or reduced trust in organizational fairness? What distinguishes authentic DEI efforts from performative ones in terms of outcomes?

### For the Problem (Step 2)
What evidence shows this problem exists?
Need to find research demonstrating widespread hiring bias in US organizations
Look for studies quantifying the financial costs of bias to companies
Search for evidence of DEI program failures or unintended negative consequences

How widespread is this problem?
Investigate whether bias patterns are consistent across different industries and organization sizes
Determine if this affects large corporations, medium businesses, or specific sectors
Examine geographic scope within the United States

What are the root causes?
Research the psychological mechanisms behind unconscious bias in hiring decisions
Investigate why current DEI programs may be ineffective or poorly designed
Explore the difference between authentic organizational commitment and performative DEI

### For the Solution (Step 4)
What evidence supports our preferred solution?
Look for experimental studies testing different types of DEI statement language
Search for research on systematic bias reduction strategies and their effectiveness
Find evidence comparing authentic vs performative DEI approaches

Has this solution worked in similar contexts?
Investigate successful DEI implementations in US-based hiring contexts
Look for evidence across different types of bias
Search for case studies in both experimental and real-world organizational settings

What are the potential risks and benefits?
Benefits to investigate: measurable bias reduction, improved diversity outcomes, financial ROI, enhanced organizational culture
Risks to consider: implementation challenges, potential resistance to change, short-term costs, risk of backlash if poorly executed
